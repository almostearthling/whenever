Build Issues
============

**whenever** is being thoroughly tested on Windows and Linux. It should work on Mac too, although
I have no possibility to test it personally. On Windows, the build process is seamless as long as
*Rust* and all its dependencies are installed.

On Linux, the build process might complain that some packages are missing: it mainly occurs because
the "essential build tools" and the *development* versions of some packages are not installed by
default. Taking Debian as an example, the following packages must be installed:


* *pkg-config*
* *libx11-dev*
* *libdbus-1-dev*
* *libxss-dev*
* *xscreensaver* (not always necessary).

With these packages installed, the scheduler compiles without errors. However, since not all Linux
distributions come with *Xscreensaver* support (which is used to determine idle time), the related
condition might not be checked and never fire. There is a *DBus* based workaround, that allows to
use `Idle session <50.conditions.md#idle-session>`_ conditions on Linux: the idle time, in this
case, is counted as the amount of seconds after the screen has been locked. To enable this
workaround, just edit the *Cargo.toml* file by uncommenting the second of the following lines:

.. code-block:: toml

   # user-idle has a problem on wayland-based sessions: work around by using
   user-idle = { version = "0.5.3", default-features = false, features = ["dbus"] }  # <-- this line must be uncommented
   # user-idle = "0.5.3"                                                             # <-- this line must be commented

and commenting the line below.
