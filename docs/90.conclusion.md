# Conclusion

The configuration of **whenever** might be difficult, especially for complex aspects such as events and conditions based on DBus. In this sense, since **whenever** does not provide a GUI, the features of the Python based _When_ are not completely matched. However, this happens to be a significant step towards solution of [issue #85](https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command/issues/85) in the Python version. Moreover, **whenever** gains some useful features (such as the _Lua_ embedded interpreter) in this transition, as well as the possibility of running on many platforms instead of being confined to a restricted number of versions of Ubuntu Linux, and the very low impact on the system in terms of resource usage. Note that the development version of [_When_](https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command), although non production ready, can be used to create and edit valid **whenever** configuration files.

I am considering **whenever** as the evolution of the original _When_ automation tool, and the current version of _When_ itself (which is now approaching version _2.0.0_) only implements the GUIs that might (or might not) be used to configure **whenever** and to control it from the system tray in a more sophisticated way than the one allowed by the minimal C++ based utility.
