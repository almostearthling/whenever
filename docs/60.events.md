# Events

Four types of event are supported, at least for now. On Linux, [DBus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) is the mechanism that handles the majority of the communication between the system and the applications, via a well described subscription mechanism. On Windows, on the other side, [WMI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) is a WBEM based interface that allows for subscription to system events in a streamlined way, thus it has been implemented specifically for the Windows platform. WMI, of course, is not available on Linux, while DBus is optionally available on Windows. Other environments may expose interfaces that are not directly supported by **whenever**.

One very specific case, which is also particularly useful, is the _notification_ of changes in the filesystem for watched entities (files or directories), which is also implemented in **whenever** as one of the possible events that can fire conditions.

The last kind of events supported by **whenever** relies on its _stdin_ based [command interface](70.intcli.md#input-commands). These events are directly raised by issuing a `trigger` command followed by the event name: a wrapper, even possibly a platform specific one, can therefore notify **whenever** that a specific event took place, or that the user explicitly required to trigger it from the available user interface. This type of event is the simplest one to define, as it has no criteria to be specified.

Note that if an event arises more that once within the tick interval, it is automatically _debounced_ and a single occurrence is counted.

All _event_ definition sections must start with the TOML `[[event]]` header.

An optional entry, namely `tags`, is accepted in item configuration: this entry is ignored by **whenever** itself, however it is checked for correctness at startup and the configuration is refused if not set to an array (of strings) or a table.

The associated conditions must exist, otherwise an error is raised and **whenever** aborts.

## Filesystem changes

This type of event arises when there is a modification in the filesystems, regarding one of more monitored files and/or directories. **whenever** allows to monitor a list of items for each defined event of this type, and to associate an _event_ based condition to the event itself. A sample configuration follows:

```toml
[[event]]
name = "FilesystemChangeEventName"
type = "fschange"
condition = "AssignedConditionName"

# optional parameters (if omitted, defaults are used)
watch = [
    "/path/to/resource",
    "/another/path/to/file.txt",
    ]
recursive = false
poll_seconds = 2
```

The configuration entries are:

| Entry              | Default | Description                                                                                |
|--------------------|:-------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`             | N/A     | the unique name of the event (mandatory)                                                   |
| `type`             | N/A     | must be set to `"fschange"` (mandatory)                                                    |
| `condition`        | N/A     | the name of the associated _event_ based condition (mandatory)                             |
| `watch`            | (empty) | a list of items to be monitored: possibly expressed with their full path                   |
| `recursive`        | _false_ | if _true_, listed directories will be monitored recursively                                |
| `poll_seconds`     | 2       | generally not used, can be needed on systems where the notification service is unavailable |

## DBus signals (optional)

DBus provides signals that can be subscribed by applications, to receive information about various aspects of the system status in an asynchronous way. **whenever** offers the possibility to subscribe to these signals, so that when the _return parameters_ match the provided constraints, then the event occurs and the associated condition is fired.

> **Note:** this type of item is only available when the `dbus` feature is enabled.

Subscription is performed by providing a _watch expression_ in the same form that is used by the [_dbus-monitor_](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-monitor.1.html) utility. The criteria that the _signal parameters_ must meet in order for the event to arise, are specified using the same format that is used for _return message parameter_ checks in [_DBus method_ based conditions](50.conditions.md#dbus-method-optional).[^1]

A sample configuration section follows:

```toml
[[event]]
name = "DbusMessageEventName"
type = "dbus"                       # mandatory value
bus = ":session"                    # either ":session" or ":system"
condition = "AssignedConditionName"
rule = """\
    type='signal',\
    sender='org.freedesktop.DBus',\
    interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',\
    member='NameOwnerChanged',\
    arg0='org.freedesktop.zbus.MatchRuleStreamTest42'\
"""

# optional parameters (if omitted, defaults are used)
parameter_check_all = false
parameter_check = [
         { index = 0, operator = "eq", value = false },
         { index = [1, 5], operator = "neq", operator = "forbidden" },
         { index = [2, "mapidx", 5], operator = "match", value = "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$" },
    ]
```

and the details of the configuration entries are described in the table below:

| Entry                 | Default | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|:-------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                | N/A     | the unique name of the event (mandatory)                                                                                    |
| `type`                | N/A     | must be set to `"dbus"` (mandatory)                                                                                         |
| `condition`           | N/A     | the name of the associated _event_ based condition (mandatory)                                                              |
| `bus`                 | N/A     | the bus on which to listen for events: must be either `":system"` or `":session"`, including the starting colon (mandatory) |
| `parameter_check_all` | _false_ | if _true_, all the provided criteria will have to be satisfied for the event to be fired, otherwise one is enough           |
| `parameter_check`     | (empty) | a list of maps consisting of three fields each, each of which is a check to be performed on return parameters               |

The considerations about indexes in return parameters are the same that have been seen for [_DBus message_ based conditions](50.conditions.md#dbus-method-optional). It is worth to remind that any errors that may arise during checks will cause the check itself to yield _false_.

If no parameter checks are provided, the event arises simply when the signal is caught.

## WMI (optional, Windows only)

On Windows, **whenever** can subscribe to _WMI_ events using [event-specific _WML_ queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/receiving-event-notifications). This kind of query allows for an extremely precise determination of every aspect of the event that has to be caught, including the possibility to specify any criteria regarding the payload of an event in order to consider it verified. Thus **whenever** leaves to the _query_ part of a _WMI_ event definition the task of filtering the specific event for which it enables a listener.

> **Note:** this type of item is only available when the `wmi` feature is enabled.

As a result, the configuration of a _WMI_ based event is much simpler than the one of _DBus signal_ based ones, by only having to specify a mandatory `query` entry, whose syntax and semantic is similar to the one of the queries used in [WMI Query](50.conditions.md#wmi-query-based-optional-windows-only) based conditions, but has to be expressly built for events.

An example of _WMI_ based event configuration follows:

```toml
[[event]]
name = "WMIEventName"
type = "wmi"  # mandatory value
condition = "AssignedConditionName"
query = """
    SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent
        WHERE TargetInstance ISA "Win32_LogicalDisk"
        AND   TargetInstance.FreeSpace < 5000000000
"""
```

which will occur every time the remaining space of a logical disk goes roughly under 5GB. The details of the configuration entries are described in the table below:

| Entry       | Default | Description                                                                         |
|-------------|:-------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`      | N/A     | the unique name of the event (mandatory)                                            |
| `type`      | N/A     | must be set to `"dbus"` (mandatory)                                                 |
| `condition` | N/A     | the name of the associated _event_ based condition (mandatory)                      |
| `query`     | N/A     | the _WQL_ query used specify what criteria must be satisfied for the event to occur |

As with DBus _match rules_, **whenever** does not do any parsing or check on the provided query: an incorrect query will only cause the event registration to fail and log an error message, at least in the _debug_ log level.

Every event returned by the system matches the criteria specified in the _query_, and will cause the assigned condition to fire.

> **Warning:** some antimalware tools might detect event subscriptions as suspicious.

## Command line

As said above, this type of event has no other parameters than the name, the type identifier, and the associated condition. All parameters are mandatory. The event is raised when a wrapper (or the user) passes a `trigger` [command](70.intcli.md#input-commands) to **whenever** through the _stdin_ stream of an active session.

A sample configuration section follows:

```toml
name = "ManuallyTriggeredEvent"
type = "cli"                        # mandatory value
condition = "AssignedConditionName"
```

and the details of the configuration entries are described in the table below:

| Entry                 | Default | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|:-------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                | N/A     | the unique name of the event (mandatory)                                                                                    |
| `type`                | N/A     | must be set to `"cli"` (mandatory)                                                                                          |
| `condition`           | N/A     | the name of the associated _event_ based condition (mandatory)                                                              |

No listening service is installed, so the impact on resource consumption and performance is almost unnoticeable.


[^1]: DBus parameters and criteria can still be expressed in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format for compatibility reasons, but this support is deprecated will be eventually removed.
