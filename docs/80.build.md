# Build Issues

**whenever** is being thoroughly tested on Windows and Linux. It should work on Mac too, although I have no possibility to test it personally. On Windows, the build process is seamless as long as _Rust_ and all its dependencies are installed.

On Linux, the build process might complain that some packages are missing: it mainly occurs because the "essential build tools" and the _development_ versions of some packages are not installed by default. Taking Debian as an example, the following packages must be installed:

* _pkg-config_
* _libx11-dev_
* _libdbus-1-dev_
* _libxss-dev_
* _xscreensaver_ (not always necessary).

With these packages installed, the scheduler compiles without errors. However, since not all Linux distributions come with _Xscreensaver_ support (which is used to determine idle time), the related condition might not be checked and never fire. There is a _DBus_ based workaround, that allows to use [Idle session](50.conditions.md#idle-session) conditions on Linux: the idle time, in this case, is counted as the amount of seconds after the screen has been locked. To enable this workaround, just edit the _Cargo.toml_ file by uncommenting the second of the following lines:

```toml
# user-idle has a problem on wayland-based sessions: work around by using
user-idle = { version = "0.5.3", default-features = false, features = ["dbus"] }  # <-- this line must be uncommented
# user-idle = "0.5.3"                                                             # <-- this line must be commented
```

and commenting the line below.
