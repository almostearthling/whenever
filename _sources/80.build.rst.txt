Building **whenever**
=====================

**whenever** is being thoroughly tested on Windows and Linux. It should work on Mac too, although
I have no possibility to test it personally. On Windows, the build process is seamless as long as
*Rust* and all its dependencies are installed.

The resulting binaries are generally autosufficient on the destination platform: no extra
libraries, other than the ones provided by the OS itself, are needed to run it from the command
line. Copying the executable file to a directory in the *PATH* or just invoking it using the
full path to the file should be enough to have it up and running.

Building from Scratch
---------------------

In order to build **whenever** a recent version of *Rust* is needed: some of the features that
have been released with version **1.87.0** have been used. Once the *Rust* requirement, along with
the toolchain for the destination platform, is fulfilled, the following build commands produce the
binaries that are normally available in the published releases:

1. on Linux:

.. code-block:: shell

   cargo build --release --no-default-features --features dbus

2. on Windows:

.. code-block:: shell

   cargo build --release --no-default-features --features wmi


This way, the produced binaries will only contain code for features that can be effectively used
on the host platform.

Build Issues
------------

On Linux, the build process might complain that some packages are missing: it mainly occurs because
the "essential build tools" and the *development* versions of some packages are not installed by
default. Taking Debian as an example, the following packages should be installed:


* *pkg-config*
* *libx11-dev*
* *libxss-dev*.

In fact, *X11* libraries are optional, and all features are now supported on Wayland desktops as
well; however, in particular, *idle time detection* can fail on Wayland desktops if *X11* support
is not available.
