<span id="main"></span><h1>The <strong>whenever</strong> Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-whenever-documentation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><strong>whenever</strong> is a lightweight task scheduler capable of executing <em>tasks</em> (in particular, OS
commands and <em>Lua</em> scripts) according to specific <em>conditions</em>. Conditions are of various types:
depending on time (both intervals or specific more-or-less defined instants), execution of OS
commands or <em>Lua</em> scripts, changes in specific files and directories, session inactivity, DBus
and WMI signals or property checks.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-1" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The scheduler intends to be as lightweight as
possible in terms of used computational resources, and to run at a low priority level.</p>
<p>Configuration is provided to the scheduler via a <a class="reference external" href="https://toml.io/">TOML</a> file, which must
contain all definitions for conditions and associated tasks, as well as events that the scheduler
should listen to.</p>
<p>Although a command line application, it is designed for desktops – therefore it should be
executed via a controlling GUI wrapper.</p>
<section id="introduction">
<span id="main-introduction"></span><h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The purpose of <strong>whenever</strong> is to provide the user, possibly without administrative credentials,
with the ability to define conditions that do not only depend on time, but also on particular
states of the session, result of commands run in a shell, execution of <em>Lua</em> scripts, or other
events that may occur while the system is being used. This scheduler is a terminal (or console,
on Windows) application, however it is meant to run in the background without interaction with
the user. The application is able to produce detailed logs, so that the user can review what the
application is doing or has done.</p>
<p>The <strong>whenever</strong> scheduler might overlap, to some extent, with the standard <em>cron</em> scheduler on
Unix, and with the <em>Task Scheduler</em> on Windows. However this tool tries to be more flexible –
although possibly less precise than <em>cron</em> – and to function as an alternative to more complex
solutions that could be implemented using the system-provided schedulers. The <strong>whenever</strong>
approach is to perform certain tasks after a condition is met, in a relaxed fashion: this means
that the tasks might not be performed <em>exactly</em> in the instant that marks the condition
verification, but <em>after</em> such verification instead. Thus this tool is not intended as a
replacement for the utilities provided by the operating system: it aims at representing an easy
solution for those who need to automate some actions depending on other situations or events that
may occur.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>whenever</strong> aims at being cross-platform: most features are available on all supported
operating systems, with the exception of</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>DBus support</em>, which is available on both Linux and Windows, but is of little or no use on
the Windows platform, and is therefore not included in the prebuilt binaries, and</p></li>
<li><p><em>WMI support</em>, which is only available on Windows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>whenever</strong> tries to be conservative in terms of resource cosumption (especially CPU and RAM),
and, since it does not interact with the user normally, it should be able to run at low priority.
Therefore, <strong>whenever</strong> does not implement a GUI by itself: on the contrary, it offers a
<a class="reference internal" href="70.intcli.html#intcli-input-commands"><span class="std std-ref">simple stdin-based interface</span></a> that is mostly aimed at interacting
with an independent <em>wrapper</em>.</p>
<p>The actions to be performed are loaded every time at startup by means of a single configuration
file that, as many modern tools do, uses the well known TOML format.</p>
<p>A very lightweight cross-platform wrapper, namely <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/almostearthling/whenever_tray">whenever_tray</a>, is available for both Linux
and Windows. Developed in C++ and using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">WxWidgets</a> GUI
library, it has been designed to implement the bare minimum of functionality and to just show an
icon in the system tray area, from which it is possible to stop the scheduler, and to pause/resume
the condition checks and therefore the execution of tasks that would derive from them. The
minimalistic wrapper also hides the console window on Windows environments. Due to the use of
<em>stdin</em>/<em>stdout</em> for communication, it is possible to build more elaborate wrappers in any
language that supports the possibility to spawn a process and control its I/O, at the expense of
a larger resource occupation but possibly without drawbacks in terms of performance, as the
scheduler runs in a separate process anyway. The original <em>Python</em> based <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command">When</a> application had
an occupation in RAM of about 70MB on Ubuntu Linux using a not-too-populated configuration file,
and could noticeably use the CPU.</p>
<p>This version, written in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> programming language, uses
around 2MB of RAM on Windows<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-2" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> with a reasonable configuration file that uses <em>tasks</em>,
<em>conditions</em>, and <em>events</em> supported on the platform. Although small in footprint, <strong>whenever</strong>
is fully multithreaded, condition checks have no influence on each other and, when needed, may
run concurrently. Consequential task execution also takes place with full parallelism – with the
exception of those tasks that, per configuration, are set to run sequentially.</p>
<p>The former version of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command">When</a> itself has currently been converted to a frontend wrapper for
<strong>whenever</strong>: see the specific repository and documentation for details.</p>

<section id="features">
<span id="main-features"></span><h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>whenever</strong> can perform the following types of <a class="reference internal" href="40.tasks.html#tasks"><span class="std std-ref">task</span></a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="40.tasks.html#tasks-command"><span class="std std-ref">Running OS executables</span></a>, either binaries or scripts,
checking their exit code or output (both on <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em>) for expected or undesired
results</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="40.tasks.html#tasks-lua"><span class="std std-ref">Running Lua scripts</span></a>, using an embedded
interpreter, with the possibility of checking the contents of <em>Lua</em> variables for expected
outcomes</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="40.tasks.html#tasks-internal"><span class="std std-ref">Running internal input commands</span></a>, to
modify the internal scheduler status at the verification of specific conditions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>as the consequence of the verification of a <em>condition</em>. The concepts of tasks and conditions
are inherited from the <em>Python</em> based <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command">When</a> scheduler.</p>
<p>The supported types of <a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions"><span class="std std-ref">condition</span></a> are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-interval"><span class="std std-ref">Interval based</span></a>: the <em>periodic</em> conditions are verified after
a certain time interval has passed since <strong>whenever</strong> has started, and may be verified
again after the same amount of time if the condition is set to be <em>recurring</em></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-time"><span class="std std-ref">Time based</span></a>: one or more instants in time can be provided for the
condition to be verified</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-idle"><span class="std std-ref">Idle user session</span></a>: this type of condition is verified after the
session has been idle for the specified amount of time</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-command"><span class="std std-ref">Command execution</span></a>: an available executable (be it a script,
a batch file on Windows, a binary) is run, its exit code or output is checked and, when an
expected outcome is found, the condition is considered verified - or failed on an explicitly
undesired outcome</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-lua"><span class="std std-ref">Lua script execution</span></a>: a <em>Lua</em> script is run using the embedded
interpreter, and if the contents of one or more variables meet the specified expectations
the condition is considered verified</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-dbus"><span class="std std-ref">DBus inspection (optional)</span></a>: a <em>DBus</em> method is called and the result
is checked against some criteria provided in the configuration file</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-wmi"><span class="std std-ref">WMI query (optional, Windows only)</span></a>: a <em>WMI</em> query is executed and
the result is checked against some criteria provided in the configuration file</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions-event"><span class="std std-ref">Event based</span></a>: are verified when a certain event occurs that fires
the condition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="60.events.html#events"><span class="std std-ref">events</span></a> that can fire <em>event</em> based conditions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="60.events.html#events-fschange"><span class="std std-ref">Filesystem changes</span></a>, that is, changes in files and/or directories
that are set to be monitored</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="60.events.html#events-dbus"><span class="std std-ref">DBus signals (optional)</span></a>, that may be filtered for an expected payload</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="60.events.html#events-wmi"><span class="std std-ref">WMI events (optional, Windows only)</span></a>, subscribed via specific <em>WQL</em> queries</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="60.events.html#events-cli"><span class="std std-ref">Command line</span></a>, that are manually triggered by writing to <strong>whenever</strong>
standard input.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <em>DBus</em> events and conditions are also supported on Windows, being one of the <em>DBus</em> target
platforms, and enabled by default.  <em>WMI</em> events and conditions, on the contrary, are only supported
on Windows platforms. Both <em>DBus</em> and <em>WMI</em> support can be <strong>disabled</strong> on build, by respectively
removing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dbus</span></code> and/or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wmi</span></code> from the default features in the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, or by building
the application with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-default-features</span></code> command line flag (in this case, other desired
features have to be specifically enabled using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--features</span></code> option). <strong>whenever</strong> can provide
the list of the available optional features by invoking <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">whenever</span> <span class="pre">--options</span></code> from the command line.</p>
<p>All of the above listed items are fully configurable via a TOML configuration file, that <em>must</em> be
specified as the only mandatory argument on the command line. The syntax of the configuration file
is described in the following sections.</p>
<p>Every type of check is performed periodically, even the ones involving <em>event</em> based
conditions<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-3" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>: the periodic time interval at which the conditions are checked is referred
here as <em>tick</em>, and the tick interval can be specified in the configuration file – defaulting at
5 seconds. Note that, since performing all checks in the same instant at every tick could cause
usage peaks in terms of computational resources, there is the option to attempt to randomly
distribute some of the checks within the tick interval, by explicitly specifying this behavior in
the configuration file.</p>
<p>The configuration can be also modified while the scheduler application is running, using a specific
<a class="reference internal" href="70.intcli.html#intcli-input-commands"><span class="std std-ref">command</span></a>, in a dynamic fashion that does not reset the items
whose configuration is unchanged.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuration">
<span id="main-configuration"></span><h2>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The configuration file is strictly based on the current TOML specification: therefore it can be
implemented by hand, or automatically written (for example, by a GUI based utility) using a library
capable of writing well-formed TOML files. This section describes the exact format of this file, in
all of its components.</p>
<p>The configuration has a <a class="reference internal" href="35.globals.html#globals"><span class="std std-ref">global section</span></a> for parameters that affect the scheduler
behavior globally, and sections for the various configuration items described above, that is</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="40.tasks.html#tasks"><span class="std std-ref">Tasks</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="50.conditions.html#conditions"><span class="std std-ref">Conditions</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="60.events.html#events"><span class="std std-ref">Events</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In configuration files generated by tools such as the current version of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command">When</a>, a special
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[tags]]</span></code> section may appear in several places, which generally contains configuration specific
to the tool itself.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If <strong>whenever</strong> has been compiled without support for one or more optional features, entries
for items depending on that feature are considered configuration errors and cause <strong>whenever</strong>

<p>Although DBus support is available on Windows too, it is mostly useful on Linux
desktops: in fact it might be appropriate to disable it when compiling the
application for Windows, in order to save resources. Binaries released for Windows
ship <em>without</em> DBus support.</p>

<p>When run alone, with no wrapper: using the minimal provided wrapper, both programs
together use less than 4MB of RAM and the combined CPU consumption in rare occasions
reaches the 0.2% – as reported by the Windows <em>Task Manager</em>.</p>

<p>The occurrence of an <em>event</em>, in fact, raises a flag that specifies that the
associated condition will be considered as verified at the following tick: the condition
is said to be thrown in a sort of “execution bucket”, from which it is withdrawn by the
scheduler that executes the related tasks. Therefore <em>event</em> based conditions are also
referred to as <em>bucket</em> conditions.</p>
